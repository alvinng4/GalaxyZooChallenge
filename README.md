# GalaxyZooChallenge
This is my attempt at Galaxy Zoo - The Galaxy Challenge on Kaggle by training CNN with PyTorch.

My best scores are as follows:
* Individual model score: 0.07972
* Model averaging: 0.07716

There are three main files in this repository:
* `PHYS4610 Galaxy Zoo.pdf`: Report
* `cnn_test.ipynb`: Notebook where I split the training dataset into training, validation and testing datasets
* `cnn.ipynb`: Notebook where I trained the model with the full training dataset
